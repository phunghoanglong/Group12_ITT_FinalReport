            <hr>
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>1. Team Name</strong></h1>
            <p>Our team name MKLP , which is a combination of the names of every member of our group (Minh, Khai,Long and Phat), is a special and individual way to make our group stand out. We may bring you a sense of cohesion and togetherness while respecting the uniqueness of each team member by putting our member’s name into one single object.
            </p>
            <p>The importance of diversity is shown in our team name. We can operate well together despite our differences in age. It is critical that everyone on our team be able to contribute to the project. Because we lack a team leader, every role in our group is the same. This allows us to create strong bonds with one another, which allows us to do our task on time and with great quality.
            </p>
            <p>This can also help us stand out in a world where there are numerous innovative team names. Having a unique name like this can assist us in making an impression on customers. This may cause consumers to remember our brand for a longer period of time, which can be quite advantageous in terms of marketing.
            </p>
            <p>Overall, our name is a method to embrace variety and togetherness while also making an impression on customers. Because this is our first project at university, we want to make something unique.</p>

            <p>Contact number: 0812888246.</p>
            <p>Interest in topic: I regularly go to the gym and use my free time to practice soft skills like cooking and self-learning. I picked up cooking so I could manage the calories and nutrients in my food. Additionally, visiting the gym helps me live a healthy lifestyle. I have observed people struggling to perform physical activities in incorrect stances. Therefore, creating this website was the finest thing I could have done.</p>
            <p>Relevant skills: Logical Thinking, Well-Organized, Self-Learning and Adaptability, Python</p>
            <p>Role in this project: I designed the website, specifically, the Machine sale page. On top of that, I also collected the perspectives of our group and wrote the group reflection. On top of that, I represented the whole group to write the Overview, Group Processes and Testing.</p>
            
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>3. Group Processes</strong></h1>
            <p>In this project, our group has made an outstanding effort to complete this assignment because we have done our best to keep in touch with each other and we also persuade our teammates to accomplish their tasks before our mini deadlines. On top of that, we divided the tasks equally for everyone. Therefore, finishing all tasks before our mini deadlines was no longer doubtful. Because this semester is the first time we have collaborated with each other, there were some obstacles that we faced. Last but not least, we hope to have more opportunities to collaborate as a team. Therefore, we can improve our skills as well as our performance.</p>
           
            <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>4. Career Plans</strong></h1>
            <p>A common element among our career plans is the desire to work in the field of Information Technology. Each person has chosen this major at RMIT and is interested in pursuing a career in a related field. We would have to take step by step by gaining experience and continuing to learn in order to improve our skills, advance careers and achieve our goals. </p>
            <p>There are also some differences between these career plans. Minh's career plan involves becoming a data scientist and specializing in topics such as data structures, that involves using data to solve complex problems and make informed decisions. While Khai is more interested in web development and software engineering which involves designing and building websites and software applications. Khai is particularly interested in personalizing services and products, and believes that artificial intelligence and machine learning will be key to achieving this goal. Phat's career plan involves working as a website developer and he recognizes the value of experience in this field. Therefore, he plans to work in this role to gain more knowledge and eventually earn a new degree to improve his chances of career advancement. Long is interested in frontend development, which involves designing and building the user interface of websites. He is attracted to the creative aspect of this role and plans to apply for full-time or freelance jobs in this field and potentially transition into teaching. These differences reflect the unique interests and goals of each person in the group.</p>
            <p>Overall, the career plans of this group are somewhat similar, as we all involve working in the field of Information Technology. However, there are also some differences in terms of specific job roles and areas of focus.</p>

        <p>We chose Figma to design a prototype of our website as it provides a workspace for working at any time, even though when all of us are modifying, it still runs normally which is an advantage of this platform. On Figma, team members have done common parts of a commercial website. To explain:</p>
        <p>Long has created a Homepage for users when they first enter the website. He also designed the template for all frames.</p>
        <p>Khai, Minh, Phat make functional frames for the websites like selling pages including supplements, clothes, equipment, and some optional features. Moreover, we have already added some interactions and transitions between frames to make our prototype more realistic.</p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>Link Github:</strong></h1>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/phunghoanglong/Group12FinalReport">Group12_FinalReport.com</a></p>
        <p>GitHub is a common service for programmers since the leader of the project could keep up with the progress and updates made by team members. We convert our document to an HTML webpage using GitHub so that our team members can work together.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red;" class="bigTitle"><strong>III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></h1>
        <hr>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>1. Overview</strong></h1>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>2. Detail Description</strong></h1>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>A. Aim</strong></h1>
            <p>The aim of our project is to make it simple for our customers to find and buy the gym supplement, equipment, and clothes that best meet their requirements. Most people have a very hard time finding the things that support their fitness objectives. Our website provides a user-friendly platform, packed with pictures and smooth animation that will make it very easy for customers to browse, read reviews and get to choose the product that is best for them. </p>
            <p>Our goal is to create a website that is easy to navigate,with detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and a safe online payment system.Our website is divided into several parts, ranging from supplements to equipment to apparel and PT packs. They are carefully isolated and made as accessible as feasible. Each product will have a separate page with extensive information and pricing to let customers pick what they want.
            </p>
            <p>Making our website as sleek as we can will attract visitors to stay on it longer. Our website is designed in dark mode to make it easier to view for extended periods of time. Each feature has been carefully designed to avoid conflict with others. Customers can find every service they require under one roof. This is highly important because a decent website will encourage users to stay on it longer, increasing the likelihood that they will purchase our product.
            </p>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>B. Plans and Progress</strong></h1>
            <p>As a group of four members with no prior experience in Information Technology, we started planning to build a website to improve the personal experience. In the beginning, Khai suggested using a 3D model to enhance customers’ shopping experience. For instance, the users just enter the sizes we need to generate 3D models of their bodies wearing our products. The rest of the group said that the teams would need a person who knows about 3D and nobody in the team could be responsible for this position. Continuously, we chose the supplements and medicines that would be our main subject for this project. However, we are uncertain about the medical knowledge and Khai said that fitness has become more popular so we decided to make a commercial website for the final idea with a personalizing feature based on the unique physical, favorite and financial needs of each individual user. Although fitness websites out there with high reputations are our challenges, noticing that they do not highly optimize the customer experience, we believed that our website would be valuable to the fitness community, as it would cater to the specific needs and goals of each user.
            </p>
            <p>In order to begin the development of our website, we have planned and set some objectives for ourselves. First and foremost, our top priority is to focus on the core functionalities such as the login feature, which is crucial in optimizing user experience. We understand that this feature is the backbone of the website and it needs to be seamless and easy to use. Second, we aim to create visually appealing home pages, search bars, and tables of contents that will make navigation more intuitive for users. This will help them have a better understanding of the website and the content that is available. Next, we will focus on creating the necessary e-commerce pages for a commercial website. These pages will be designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate so that users can easily find what they're looking for. By focusing on these objectives, we hope to make sure that our website will be an enjoyable and seamless experience for all users.
            </p>
            <p>In the beginning, we discussed what would be included in our selling pages so we came up with products like whey, vitamins, clothes, and equipment such as treadmills, massage tools, etc. A unique feature called PFit was intended to help customers find the best suitable products and exercises through the options that we provide. For example, some people lack shoulder mobility to perform a full range of movements. Therefore, when they choose those selections from the website, the system will recommend stretching or mobility exercises to improve their flexibility. Moreover, it would include filters for sorting fitting products like favorite brands, lactose intolerance, flavors, and so on. After discussing, we immediately seek ways to program the website along with database processing.</p>
            <p>As all of us do not have any experience with IT, a fully functional website with a database is something we are unable to do at this time so our goal was set to make a prototype of our future website. To bring our idea to life, we decided to use Figma, a platform for creating prototypes, since all group members could interact with it at the same time without lagging. None of us had used Figma before and we had to teach ourselves as we went along. It was a steep learning curve, but we were motivated and committed to making our website a success.</p>
            <p>Minh, Khai, and Phat designed essential functions for a commercial website such as an “appearance” page for clothes shopping, “supplements” for selling consumable products, and an “equipment” to provide for personal demands from customers. In the “appearance”, we have several types of clothes like tops, tanks, leggings & paintings, jackets & hoodies, and socks that come from different brands: Gymshark, Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour. “Supplements” page has whey, BCAA, EAA, Creatine, Pre-Workout, and Vitamins. “Equipment” page has treadmills, massagers, indoor and outdoor machines. These three main pages have the same function when you click on the type you want to buy it would sort out. While three people doing their work, Long creates templates and layouts for the whole website, he is also responsible for creating the home page of the website and features such as new information for trainees and frequently asked questions.</p>
            <p>After working for a period of time, we realized the task of building a special feature - PFit - to optimize the training and consumption experience on the Figma platform, is currently beyond our capability. Instead, to replace PFit, we would allow users to directly hire personal trainers through our website, with the name PT Pack. We knew that personal trainers could be the person that gives advice and support our customers with each body condition since this is their profession. So, we began to design this section on Figma.
            </p>
            <p>After more than two weeks of working tirelessly to design the various pages for our website, we had finally reached a point where we could start linking and creating transitions between the frames. Our goal was to make the template run like a commercial website, where users can navigate smoothly between the different pages and access the information and features they need easily. We are putting in a lot of effort to make sure that the website is both user-friendly and visually appealing. With the linking and transitioning phase now underway, we are one step closer to bringing the website to life and making it accessible to the public.</p>
            <p>However, there is an issue that we are still trying to resolve which is when we run the Figma prototype, the frames overflow on the screen despite the settings we set at 1920x1080. When our team searched for solutions online, the community suggested that we should design with an auto layout to make the frames responsive. This means that we need to redesign the whole interface from scratch at a higher level using Figma, but that is not possible within our limited time and knowledge. As a result, we have decided to retain the old design and accept that it would not be modified further.
            </p>
            <p>In the last 1 weeks, we began to complete the final report and its HTML version. Long started to divide the tasks such as Khai would be responsible for writing the sections of plan & progress, career plan, tools, and technologies. Minh would work on the sections of project outcome, the meaning of the group name, and aim. Phat’s part would be group reflection, overview, and testing. Long is in charge of PowerPoint, skill & jobs, and scope & limits.
            </p>
            <p>After completing everything within our ability, our future plan for this project is to turn it from a Figma prototype into a live website. We will also consider implementing a database to collect information about the fitness industry in order to design the Pfit feature that we had to drop. This will truly help both new and experienced users understand more about their own human body.	</p>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>C. Roles</strong></h1>
            <p>Most of our members are freshmen, which is one of the first courses for most of us. Therefore, to learn and divide roles in this project professionally is not easy.

            </p>
            <p>Since this is a Figma project, the Backend Development role does not exist in our plan for the division of roles. We do not think that swapping roles during project execution will keep individuals from focusing on their own roles. However, all members must have adequate Figma knowledge and understand the project plan to fulfill their individual roles.
            </p>
            <p>To understand this project more deeply, we sat down to refer to professional sales websites and outlined the steps to take. There are 2 main steps: designing the page structure and collecting information. Product information is about to build each sales section for the MKLP website.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the design of the website structure is entrusted to the Technical Designer and the User Interface Designer. This work is researched by member Long, he offers simple and powerful design ideas aimed at the audience who needs to use services and buy sports products. Moreover, to provide a complete sales website requires detailed pages, and this will also be researched and planned by the Technical Designer.

            </p>
            <p>The second role, Minh, Khai and Phat are those who research and put products to sell to build the website, calling this role Product Researcher. The main job of the product research staff is to classify and find nutrition, fashion, and exercise products from official sales websites and then bring them back to create a Sale Page. Each of the three divides into a product category, puts prices, product details and images and collects them to put on the site. In addition, Minh, Khai, Phat will be responsible for creating a template for their product sales page, researching and linking that page with other pages of the website such as homepage, payment page,...

            </p>
            <p>In a nutshell, there is no swapping of roles in the project and the nature of each role requires understanding all of the site's knowledge and plans, so all team members can clearly and completely understand them. work component. their job but still fully understand and learn more knowledge in the process of working</p>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>D. Scope and Limits</strong></h1>
            <p>After starting to learn and implement the web sales project, we realized the limitations of the project with the help of Figma besides the ones we did.
            </p>
            <p>The planned ranges have been fully implemented, from the homepage to the sales pages and the features we wish to have. However, in the contact section, we were unable to add the map direction as intended for the extent.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are limitations that figma cannot do. Figma's prototype helped us a lot in switching between pages by clicking the buttons we had planned. But the limit is only Move to an existing page. When users want to add to their bags or check out the products they want to buy, we can simply direct them to the checkout with 2 items already prepared.
            </p>
            <p>In summary, we have successfully completed the areas that we have implemented as planned. However, there are limits to increasing user purchases that Figma can't help with. We are looking forward to having more new knowledge to complete this idea of the group.
            </p>
            
            

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>E. Tools and Technologies</strong></h1>
            <p>For this project, the following software and tools will be required:
            </p>
            <p>1.Figma - a cloud-based design and prototyping tool.</p>
            <p>2.GitHub - a web-based version control platform. Group members prioritize GitHub desktop for collaborating on projects using GitHub
            </p>
            <p>Both these tools are easily used on a normal PC or a laptop, but may not work well on weak devices. Optionally, it would be better if you use stronger hardware because when designing a prototype on Figma, there are many transitions or links between frames which may cause a bit of lag.</p>
            <p>No software licenses are required for these tools, as they are free to use. However, it is important to ensure that all group members have accounts set up and are familiar with the basic functionality of both Figma and GitHub before starting the project.
            </p>
            <p>None of the group members have prior experience with these tools. However, both tools offer extensive documentation and resources to get started.
            </p>
            <p>Figma provides a variety of tutorials, articles, and video guides to help new users learn the platform. Every design, function, transition, like an actual website you could find out easily as it has a strong community willing to help you from beginner to advanced users.</p>
            <p>GitHub is also taught in tutorial class so we could use it at an appropriate level but there are still many online tutorials and forums which would help you immediately when you got troubles
            </p>
            
            

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>F. Testing</strong></h1>
            <p> To have our project in the most perfect condition at the end, there is no doubt that the most essential step is testing. This step must be repeated several times once changes were made to develop our product. Figma is a good website, however, when we tested our website, some problems appeared. Although our team has done a great job linking every page with every button to make a good prototype, when we tested all the links that we had made were disabled. Thanks to this testing step, we could figure out those problems and solve them.
            </p>
            
            

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>G. Risks</strong></h1>
            <p>During the implementation of the project, we have faced risks from large to small. First of all the 4 of us are beginners and the figma background is new to all . We have consulted and learned from tutorials on the Internet like google and YouTube, but to combine it with an idea and a large website like this is not easy.</p>
            <p>The first concern was that we chose the wrong format for a whole project that should have stopped at the 1440 x 990 frame format but we developed in a larger format 1920x1080. When starting the display, the screen is not large enough to contain the whole frame, resulting in the user having to drag left and right to see the entire web page. Since we have almost finished developing the whole project, we decided to keep this date format agent immutable for all frameworks. This is a great lesson for all of us, and we will choose a more suitable frame for the website next time.
            </p>
            <p>In the process of doing it, we also ran into an accident that scared all the members that the Figma tool website was under maintenance due to overload at a time when we were all sitting together to work. efficient work. At that time, all the members thought that what they had done was gone before they archived them, but fortunately, the website was fixed for a short time. After that, we were able to return to work that same night. This is a lesson as well as a risk that should be paid attention to because it can slow down the process and work morale of all members working on a project together at a pre-arranged time. Finding a time where all members can sit together and work on projects is quite difficult because each person has their work and assignments in other subjects.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, mishaps are inevitable misfortunes in a team project. However, if we dig into the first requirement of the tool, we can avoid the risk of minor problems, similar to our frame format problem.

            </p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>H. Group processes and communications</strong></h1>
            <p>It cannot be denied that communication in the team is a factor that directly affects the team's work efficiency and mutual understanding in the project. Our team has workplace communication rules and organizes two forms of communication, offline and online.
            </p>
            <p>First of all, we are students from different provinces, not from HCMC. So the time to be in HCMC to meet in person is in the Tutorial class. We choose a time after the end of each week to hold an offline session and talk about planning our to-dos for the week. Each offline session lasts from 30-45 minutes depending on the content of the meeting.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Facebook Messenger, there is a group chat to constantly update information and help the rest of the group get timely help and raise your problem with the rest of the members. Ideas are always effective and are approved by all members of the team in the fastest way. Besides, Discord is the official way to call a meeting for the whole team. There is usually an online meeting every Tuesday to talk about what we've been up to since last Thursday with all members. In addition, group calls will arise to share work or consult with all individuals respectfully.
          
          </p>
            <p>When one of the members cannot attend the regular meeting, we require that member to give 2 to 3 days notice and clearly state the reason. If a person cannot attend the regular meeting and we cannot contact him for up to 3 days, the temporary solution would be to divide the work equally among the remaining members. If we can't contact this person for more than 10 days, we must report to the instructor and find a new member.</p>
            <p>In short, communication and processes throughout our project work very well thanks to the sense of updating each individual's message. Fortunately, no member was absent or ignored the group's announcement, and still completed individual tasks in this project.

        <hr>
            <p>MKLP Fitness Provider is a website that provides all fitness and fitness-related products and services to consumers who are new to sports experience and who need to purchase fitness products and services. This offering requires vendors and website developers to constantly update products and monitor personal trainer services to meet user needs. To do this and develop the website to the fullest, we think it will need dedication to the following positions:</p>
            <p>The first important position is Developer, specifically Lead Backend Developer with 3-5 years of experience. This is the job of keeping the website running smoothly, and providing and maintaining the website's features to satisfy the users. Currently, our website still lacks features to maximize the usability of the sales website such as AI Chatbot, user credit score, promotion code, and website referral code, ... and these are the tools that require developers to add in the future. At the same time, the developer must have the skills to manage the sales data of the website and create SKUs for each product to classify and sell. Finally, backend developers must have the skills to collaborate with designers to ensure the visual element is working properly.</p>
            <p>The next required work is a User Interface Designer. From our perspective, MKLP has been designed in a semi-professional way, but the interface of the sales section still needs editing to reach more users. So we want to target Apprentice Designers, who have 1-2 years of semi-professional experience but still meet the aesthetic market. An attractive website is important, but incorporating features that are capable of developers is not an easy task. Therefore, we need to find a Designer who has a high ability to collaborate rather than being too professional with just one design.</p>
            <p>Besides developing and maintaining the MK LP website, We need to bring it to more and more customers. Our website has the idea of providing a full range of fitness products and services for everyone. to all beginners and experienced people in training. It's a new idea to combine selling products and personal coaching services together, and this will work for busy customers. A professional Marketing Strategy is a missing piece in the team. We require experience in marketing as well as SEO of your products in search engines in an effective way to bring your website to google users. Marketers require social network algorithms, knowing how to run ads, and coming up with recurring strategies and ideas like understanding discounts or freebies for new customers. 3 years of experience is the minimum for this position as this is a new project that requires maximum user reach.</p>
            <p>The last member we are looking for is a site manager. The manager's job is to bring team members together to understand the ideas of both designers and developers to ensure the most effective work and maintenance of the website. . The website manager directly receives users' comments about the website to find remedies and improve, and marketing ideas from the position of a marketer will be transferred to the website manager and given to the department. development department as sales events, you need support from the backend supporting the final developer's programming. Managers will hold the data and information to know the status of the website to make user-directed marketing or remedial requests. We need 4 to 5 years of experience for this position.</p>
            <p>In short, we want to maximize what we can for the website and bring the website to more users so the 4 places above the name are necessary to get quick results and be effective for both investors and the founder.</p>

    <div id="projectOutcome">
        <h1 style="color: red;" class="bigTitle"><strong>V. PROJECT OUTCOME / PRODUCT PROTOTYPE
        </strong></h1>
        <hr>
            <p>Our team is now using Figma to design and construct a sample version of our website. While the sample version is not a completely functional website, it allows us to present the essential features and functionalities that we intend for the final product.</p>
            <p>The sample website offers an extensive catalog of gym supplements, equipment and fashion clothing from major  manufacturers and distributors, complete with product information, pricing, and all necessary information. Users can compare different items and pick the best solutions for their needs. The website also has a user-friendly interface, clear and simple product descriptions, and a secure online checkout process.</p>
            <p>Another website feature is a user-friendly design with clear and simple product descriptions, as well as a secure online checkout process. This makes it simple for consumers to explore the site, locate what they're looking for, and make secure purchases. </p>
            <p>Figma is an amazing tool for building a website for beginners, but it has its limitations. It is hard to make changes when the design is completed.This is due to Figma's limited versatility and customisation as compared to using Github to share our code when working with HTML and CSS. This implies that changing the layout or appearance of the design sometimes necessitates starting from scratch or making considerable changes to the existing design, both of which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.</p>
            <p>Product comparison tools and expert evaluations are also available on the website to assist clients in making informed purchasing selections. Customers benefit from these resources because they help them narrow down their selections and find the finest items for their needs.</p>
            <p>While the demo website lacks a full database and other real-world website functionalities, it is a useful prototype for our team to show our process of making a website . We are continuously working to complete the Figma prototype as we try to learn more knowledge about Html, Css and JavaScript in order to construct a website that has all the functionality in the future.</p>

        <h1 style="color: red;" class="bigTitle"><strong>VI. GROUP REFLECTION</strong></h1>
        <hr>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>1. Group Reflection</strong></h1>
            <p>During this project, we recognized the core value of teamwork for the best outcome. Therefore, we have conducted several discussion meetings as a way to complete the idea as well as to improve our team chemistry. Although most of us are freshmen, we have overcome all the problems that we faced.  Consequently, we admitted that we have done a great job in communicating in this project. At first, we were still hesitant to interact with each other. However, the longer we worked together, the closer we became.</p>
	        <p>Astonishingly, the Pfit function was our unique feature at the beginning of the project. However, it turned out that our level cannot meet the requirements for that feature. Instead of realizing that feature, we had discussed and went to a decision to make an alternative feature which users can choose and hire Personal Trainers straight from the website. This method can help our customers to get support and clarification from the PTs and they will also consult the customers to choose the service which fits them the most. On top of that, the productivity of the whole team is really astounding. To make it clearer, every mini deadline was met by the whole group without being told to do their tasks.</p>
            <p>It is doubtful that we did a good job together in this project. Nonetheless, we have to admit that there are several weaknesses that need to be improved significantly. First of all, the frame of our website was in the wrong scale which does not fit the monitors of our devices. After having recognized this problem, we have already completed our product and there was not enough time for our group to rescale this product. This is a huge mistake that we made, and we will pay more attention to researching the tools that we will utilize as well as the basic knowledge to complete the upcoming project as well as we can. In addition, planning time is also our weakness. We started doing the website 4 weeks before the deadline but we spent so much time learning Figma and making the website, we should have studied it in advance to implement the progress faster. Those are the two things that we could learn from experience.</p>
            <p>We have worked together since the beginning of this semester. Therefore, we have learned some things about the group. First and foremost, trusting is the most paramount important element to create an efficient team. Believing in the ability and skills of each member allows us to be brave to face our vulnerability. So we can know where the expertise is, and know which tasks should not be given to our teammates. Furthermore, the more we communicate, the more possible benefits of teamwork we can gain. Clear communication is a crucial component of effective teamwork, tagging people is also a good idea as they are notified and they do not miss the essential resources and information. Last but not least, avoiding conflicts and ensuring the happiness of everyone is extremely important. Happy people are always productive, and it is what we learned from our experience.</p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>Cao Le Hoang Minh - Information Technology student (sID :  s3979628)</strong></h1>
            <p>We think our team did well. Well-communicated. We spoke frequently, provided updates, and requested assistance via video call and chat. We stayed on track and improved the website.</p>
            <p>Our planning needs improvement. Last-minute additions and changes were common. This delayed our schedule and made organizing harder. Future preparation and sticking to our strategy may help us.</p>
            <p>Online collaboration shocked me. We were pleasantly surprised by how effectively working remotely worked for communication and collaboration. We collaborated on the website, shared files, and scheduled meetings using Messenger, Discord, and Microsoft Teams.</p>
            <p>Group organization and communication are essential. Regular check-ins using a shared document (Google Docs, Figma) helped us track our progress and assign assignments.</p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>Dang Truong Phat - Information Technology student (sID: s3963893)</strong></h1>
            <p>Our teamwork was great. We live too far apart to meet in person. Instead, we hold meetings and discussions online. It's also fantastic since my teammates were understanding when I was occupied outside and could not work with them.</p>
            <p>We had some last-minute alterations despite working effectively together. We managed those changes before our mini-deadlines. Thus, I believe that planning should be the first thing improved in the next project so that everyone can work efficiently.</p>
            <p>Our collaboration and eagerness to help surprised me. As a freshman, I did not know what tools to use for the assignment, so my colleagues, who had studied before me, helped me choose and apply those tools.</p>
            <p>This project taught me Figma and time management. I quit playing games and surfing the Internet to work and meet mini-deadlines. I finally know how to use Figma after constructing our product.</p>

        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>Ngo Quang Khai - Information Technology student (sID: s3975831)</strong></h1>
            <p>After the proposal, our team put in extra effort to create a Figma prototype, which led to an improvement in team chemistry. This was the first time we had used Figma, so we held meetings to design a template and mechanics for our website. Despite living far apart, we still managed to spend time working on the website. </p>
            <p>However, I faced a problem when Tet, a special event in Vietnam, was approaching. My neighbors had to prepare for the occasion, making it harder for me to use the Internet as workers were repairing everything, including the electricity, which affected the surrounding area and transmission route. But, my team members were understanding and helped me with my tasks. </p>
	        <p>During this project, I realized that design and Internet skills are essential. I learned how to make a website more attractive through logos, templates, and layouts. Additionally, I improved my keyboard shortcuts to optimize my working time. </p>
            <p>Working in a team helped me understand that there are many areas that need improvement. For example, I had to start using Figma from scratch, and it took me time to get used to it. To achieve the best outcome for the project, I must strive harder and not let my limitations hold me back as it improves our team's connection, as we always help each other to deal with different troubles.</p>
        <h1 class="mediumTitle"><strong>Phung Hoang Long - Information Technology student (sID :  s3965673)</strong></h1>
            <p>After 3 months of building this project, I have created a website that sells and provides fitness services, and my teammates and I have had a pretty good experience working together. The planning and building of the website image happened quickly and everyone was very cooperative in the assigned work. However, the remaining members are quite passive when they can't find their own work or ideas for the project but only follow the assigned work, not enthusiastic about specific small jobs. I think if we are more proactive in building and dividing work fairly, the collective spirit will be more stable and there will be no situation where people do more and people do less. In the future, I want my team to be more understanding and responsible in regular meetings or meal appointments to improve work efficiency. In short, this is a not-so-optimistic experience when you have to divide the work between the rest of the team and perform your part of the responsibilities.</p>
